Replaced state.stuck with state.freeze
Replaced state.userDirection with state.wantedUserDirection
Replaced state.validDirection with state.currentDirection

TO DO
see if you can remove pacman.type

How Pacman works
	Pacman draw method constantly monitors the coordinates of pacman and draws pacman with it's center located exactly on pacman's coordinates.
	Pacman does it's animation by keeping 2 helper variables: isOpening and  
  Pacman updates it's position 60 times per second, unless he either reached his destination object or he is stuck;
 
  After pacman reaches the center of the destination,
  he is actually moved in the coresponding place in the map array;

  The keyhandler changes the  boolean stuck to false in order to allow the loop of the game
  to check once more if the direction, now changed by the user also by this
  keyhandler is a good one (no wall upfront).
  The keyhandler does not modify the validDirection directly,
 instead it modifies the userDirection property. If userDirection is a good direction
 (it is checked in the game.start() method), than the validDirection is assigned the value of userDirection.
 The animation progress is directly affected by how much pacman moves. Thus, when pacman is stuck, the animation stops as well.
 reachedDestination and stuck are needed to allow verifying if the pacman's direction is good after he has been stuck.
 After pacman arrives to a new center of a tile(a new destination), he needs to update his position in the map array as well. The purpose of
	"needsSwap" is to tell whether pacman has already updated his position in the map.
 animationStage, maxAnimationStage and isOpening are needed for the animation of pacman (opening and closing mouth)
  The changeDirection() function changes pacman's velocity based on the current valid direction
 
 











next tile is food or powerup -> run collisionDetection between pacman and the next tile every 1/60 second
when the collisionDetection is true, replace the static type element with ' ', stop the collisionDetection and redraw the static canvas.
